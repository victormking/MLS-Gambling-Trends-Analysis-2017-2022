# MLS-Gambling-Trends-Analysis-2017-2022

## Project Overview

This project examines Major League Soccer (MLS) gambling trends between 2017 and 2022 to uncover profitable betting strategies. By analyzing historical betting odds, point spreads, and game results, the study aims to reveal patterns that could improve predictions and support bettors' decision-making.

## Objectives

Analyze Betting Trends: Identify patterns in betting odds and game outcomes for MLS teams to uncover valuable betting strategies.

Predictive Modeling: Create predictive models that utilize historical betting odds to forecast game results.

Statistical Insights: Provide analytical insights into how betting odds and spreads influence game predictions.

## Data Sources

MLS Betting Data: Comprehensive data covering betting odds, point spreads, and game results for MLS games from 2017 to 2022.

## Methodology

## Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Standardized and removed duplicate records to ensure data consistency.

Created new features to highlight key betting trends across MLS teams.

Aggregated data to analyze overall league trends and team-specific patterns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized trends in odds and spreads for MLS teams over several seasons.

Identified correlations between betting odds, spreads, and game outcomes.

Investigated betting patterns for both favorites and underdogs to identify potential biases.

## Predictive Modeling:

Developed predictive models using historical betting odds and spreads to forecast game outcomes.

Evaluated model performance through cross-validation and test datasets.

Applied feature selection methods to identify key predictors of betting success.

## Visualization:

Created comprehensive visualizations to highlight trends in betting odds and game outcomes.

Leveraged ggplot2 to provide advanced graphical representations of betting trends.

## Key Findings

## Betting Patterns:

Favorites vs. Underdogs: There was a strong bias towards betting on favorites, which generally reflected accurate odds predictions. However, betting on underdogs in specific high-stakes matches showed higher 
returns, especially when the favorites were on losing streaks.

Point Spread Trends: Point spread trends revealed profitable opportunities when betting on underdogs that historically outperformed their odds. Notably, certain teams consistently covered the spread even as underdogs.

Totals Market: The totals market showed a significant trend where defensive teams repeatedly led to low-scoring matches, making under bets more profitable than over bets.

Model Performance:

Predictive models leveraging historical betting odds and spreads proved effective in forecasting game outcomes. Models that integrated historical team performance data alongside betting odds achieved higher 
prediction accuracy.

Strategic Insights:

Monitoring betting odds adjustments provided valuable insights into potential market manipulation or insider knowledge, particularly in matches with sudden odds shifts.
Point spread analysis showed that certain teams consistently covered spreads, offering betting opportunities on underdog lines.

## Conclusion

The MLS-Gambling-Trends-Analysis-2017-2022 project provides comprehensive insights into MLS betting trends:

Betting odds generally align with match outcomes, but strategic opportunities arise when following underdog trends.

Predictive models can identify matches where historical odds adjustments signal profitable wagering opportunities.

In-depth data analysis offers valuable guidance for bettors seeking to refine their strategies through historical MLS betting trends.

This project demonstrates the potential of using statistical models and advanced data analysis techniques to identify profitable betting trends in MLS games, empowering bettors to make more informed decisions.

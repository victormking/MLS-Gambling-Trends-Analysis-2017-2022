# MLS-Gambling-Trends-Analysis-2017-2022

## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of betting trends in Major League Soccer (MLS) from 2017 to 2022, focusing on how different factors impact the accuracy of betting odds and returns. By analyzing data from multiple betting platforms like Bet365 and BetWay, the project seeks to uncover patterns in the betting landscape that could help bettors make more informed decisions. The project emphasizes predictive modeling techniques, exploring how various trends and biases can be used to maximize returns or better evaluate the probability of match outcomes.

## Objectives

Identify Key Trends: Explore how betting odds and returns have varied across different seasons and platforms.

Analyze Predictive Factors: Investigate the impact of team statistics, venue effects, and consecutive wins/losses on betting outcomes.

Develop Predictive Models: Create predictive models that use historical betting and game data to forecast match outcomes and evaluate the reliability of various platforms.

## Data Sources

MLS 2017-2022 Betting Data: Contains data on betting odds, returns, and game results from various betting platforms for the MLS seasons between 2017 and 2022. The data provides comprehensive information for analysis.

## Methodology

Data Collection: Scraped data from betting websites and gathered historical game results to create a robust dataset.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handled missing and incorrect values, standardized column types, and created new features for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized trends and patterns in betting odds and returns across different seasons and teams.

Investigated venue effects, team performance statistics, and hot/cold streaks.

## Predictive Modeling:

Developed machine learning models to predict match outcomes using historical betting data.

Evaluated model accuracy and performance using validation and test sets.

## Visualization:

Created graphical representations of trends using ggplot2 and other visualization tools.

## Key Findings

Betting Biases: Identified potential biases in betting platforms due to streaks (hot hand effect), venue effects, and team reputations.

Predictive Models: Models demonstrated significant accuracy in forecasting match outcomes, revealing patterns that bettors could leverage.

Strategic Insights: Statistical analysis provided actionable insights into betting trends, enabling bettors to adjust their strategies and maximize returns.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of MLS betting trends from 2017 to 2022, uncovering patterns that affect betting odds and returns.
